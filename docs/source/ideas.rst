Some ideas for the documentation:
=================================
- Getting started page with installation and so on
- user guide: 
    - rough overview of how each state works 
    - input and output of each state
    - ```hsrb_mode```/```eth_mode```
    - How to add pose estimator
    - explanation of windows when doing gp and rv (and which topics are interesting)
- API reference:
    - more detailed description of each state
    - doc of each function
    - https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/classes.html

--------------------
TODOs:
--------------------

- [ ] Add short description of each state + input and output
- [ ] Add screenshot of the state machine (Main components, and then more detailed view)?
- [ ] Add screenshots of the windows when doing gp and rv and list all interesting topics
- [ ] Add API reference (doc of each function and more detailed description of each state)
- [ ] Add a getting started page
- [ ] Fix weird link-missing behavior of the overview on the left hand side
- [ ] Check whether curl link is working once doc is pushed on main.
- [ ] Let others read doc and give feedback (they should also look at what links are missing for interactive traversal)
