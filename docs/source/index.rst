Welcome to Grasping Pipeline's documentation!
=============================================

The Grasping Pipeline implements a somewhat modular pipeline for grasping, placing and handing over objects with the Toyota HSR robot. 
The pipeline is implemented in Python and uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) for communication with the robot.

.. note:: This documentation is a work in progress.
